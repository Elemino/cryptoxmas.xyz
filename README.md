# üéÅ Crypto Christmas [WIP] üé∫


## Christmas Cards & Gifts on Ethereum

With non-fungible Ethereum Christmas Cards you can send messages & gifts to your friends or people in need. 

### Share Christmas Cards & Gifts with anyone

Using the eth2.io technology you can generate a simple URL, sendable to anyone ‚Äî just like a text message. 
The receiver simply opens the link, gets forwarded to install a wallet and receive the Christmas Card (ERC721 token) and (optionally) ETH. The Christmas Card and ETH are securely hold in an escrow smart contract, until the receiver claims them. If nobody claims the crypto, you can just claim it back yourself.

### Donate tokens to people in need

You can attach an Etheruem or ERC20 donation to a Charity DAO, saving the christmas for the people most in need.

## How it works

### Send

### Receive
![Receive](/public/eth2phone_receive.png)

- The receiver claims Christmas Card and optional eth. The escrow contract transfers the Christmas Card from the website's address to the receiver‚Äôs address
